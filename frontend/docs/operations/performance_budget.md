# Frontend Performance Budget Contract

This document defines enforceable bundle-size budgets for the frontend foundation.

## Budget Policy Source

- Policy file: `performance/bundle_budget.json`
- Enforcement script: `scripts/performance-budget.mjs`

## Metrics

The gate evaluates production artifacts in `dist/assets`:

- Total JavaScript raw bytes
- Total JavaScript gzip bytes
- Total CSS raw bytes
- Total CSS gzip bytes

## Enforcement Rule

- `npm --prefix frontend run build` must fail when any budget threshold is exceeded.
- Build command runs `npm run perf:check` after Vite production build.

## Commands

- Build with budget gate: `npm --prefix frontend run build`
- Run budget check against existing dist assets: `npm --prefix frontend run perf:check`

## Reviewer Impact Checklist

- Dependency updates include budget impact assessment.
- Route-level or shared UI additions include bundle impact notes when significant.
- Threshold changes in `performance/bundle_budget.json` require explicit reviewer approval and rationale.
